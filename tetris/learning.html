<h1>  Reinforcement Learning </h1>
In an <a href="tetris.html">AI project</a> we 
used reinforcement learning to have an agent figure out
how to play tetris better.
The writeup here is just a brief introduction to reinforcement learning.
There may be other explanations to the concepts
of reinforcement learning that can be found on
the web or in various AI textbooks.  Anyways, Enjoy...


<h2>Introduction </h2>
Animals cannot be reasoned with.  They dont understand 
human language or explainations.  Yet somehow
it is possible to train a pet to stop doing bad
behavior, such as chewing on furniture, and 
get it to perform good tasks such as fetching the newspaper.
The technique used to program this living agent
is reinforcement learning.   The pet recieves a treat
when it does something good and is punished when
it does something bad.   
<p>
It is possible to train computer based agents
using a similar technique of giving "general" rewards and penalties.
Furthermore, reinforcement learning is able
to train agents in unknown 
environments where there may be a delay before
the effects of actions are understood.  i.e. rewards
and penalties are not issued right away.
For example, an agent playing chess may not 
realize that it has made a "bad move" until
it loses its queen a few turns later.
<p>


<h2> Value Iteration </h2>
In a reinforcement learning situation an agent knows
what state it is in and it has a number of 
actions it can perform in each state.
Initilly it doesn't know the value of any of the states.
For now we will assume that the outcome of performing
an action at a state is deterministic.
The agent can therefore update the utility value U() of a state 
whenever it makes a transition from one state
to another (by taking what it believes to be the
best possible action and thus maximizing):
<code><pre>
  U(oldstate) = reward + U(newstate)
</pre></code>
Thus the agent learns the utility values of states
as it works its way through the state space.
The agent may occasionally choose to explore
suboptimal moves in the hopes of finding better outcomes.
Only by visiting all the states frequently enough can
we gaurantee learning the true values of all the states.
<p>
As discussed in the deleted homework problem,
a discount factor is often introduced to prevent
utility values from diverging and to promote 
the use of shorter (more efficient) sequences 
of actions to attain rewards.  
The update equasion using
a discout factor gamma is:
<code><pre>
  U(oldstate) = reward + gamma * U(newstate)
</pre></code>
Normally gamma is set between 0 and 1.

<h2> Q-Learning </h2>
One assumtion with value iteration is that the effect 
of an action at a state (resulting state) is deterministic.
Unfortunately, an environment may not guarantee this.
A method known as Q-learning augments value iteration
by maintaining a utility value Q(s,a) for ever action
at every state.  
The utility of a state U(s) or Q(s)
is simply the maximum Q value over 
all the possible actions at that state.
The Q-learning algorithm is as follows:
<code><pre>
  foreach state s 
    foreach action a
      Q(s,a)=0
  s=currentstate
  do forever
      a = select an action
      do action a
      r = reward from doing a
      t = resulting state from doing a
      Q(s,a) += alpha * (r + gamma * (Q(t)-Q(s,a))
      s = t                     
</code></pre>
Notice that a learning coefficient, alpha, has been
introduced into the update equasion.  Normally alpha
is set to a small positive constant less than 1.
<p>
A varient of Q-Learning is average learning.  
With average learning the amount that Q(s,a) is 
incremented is inversly proportional
to the number of times that Q(s,a) has been visited.
i.e. it is equivalent to setting alpha to 1/frequency(Q(s,a)).
This gives equal weighting to all the "samples" taken
for that action value pair.  Furthermore this prevents
ossilation since the amount that a Q value can vary
will decrease with time.


<h2> TD-Learning </h2>
An extention to value iteration or Q-learning is TD-learning.
Q-learning only updates utility values based on the transition
between 2 adjacent states.  When rewards occur infrequently,
it can take many learning trials for these values to propogate
to previous states.  TD-learning attempts to expedite this process
by updating the value of a state using values and rewards from a number
of future states and actions.  
For example, the value iteration update equasion
can be augmented as follows:
<code><pre>
  U(s0) = (1-lamda)*sum(pow(lamda,i-1)*(ri + U(si)))
                     i=1 to i=maxi
  where
    si = i'th state in the future from s0
    ri = reward at i'th future action from s0
</pre></code>
The constant lambda adds an exponential decay to
the influence of future states.  lamda is normally
set between 0 and 1.  The lower the value of lamda is,
the less influence future rewards will have.

<h2> Application </h2>

Sounds like a nifty technique eh? 
There are lots of sexy AI algorithms out there, but have they
ever been able to do anything useful?  Can we solve a real problem?
Hmmm.   Well we had a bit of success with a 
little <a href="tetris.html">tetris</a> game.
What's interesting is that rather than studying 
the application domain ourselves and applying our learning
into the code, the learning algorithm, without prior knowledge
or strategies, was able to adapt to learn and play effectively.
