			3x3 Matrix Diagonalization

		<p>Simple <a href="https://github.com/melax/sandbox">C++ code</a> that finds a quaternion which diagonalizes a 3x3 matrix:
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>
				<pre>
  Quaternion Diagonalizer(const float3x3 &amp;A)
  {
	// A must be a symmetric matrix.
	// returns quaternion q such that its corresponding matrix Q 
	// can be used to Diagonalize A
	// Diagonal matrix D = Q * A * Transpose(Q);  and  A = QT*D*Q
	// The rows of q are the eigenvectors D's diagonal is the eigenvalues
	// As per 'row' convention if float3x3 Q = q.getmatrix(); then v*Q = q*v*conj(q)
	int maxsteps=24;  // certainly wont need that many.
	int i;
	Quaternion q(0,0,0,1);
	for(i=0;i &lt; maxsteps;i++)
	{
		float3x3 Q  = q.getmatrix(); // v*Q == q*v*conj(q)
		float3x3 D  = Q * A * Transpose(Q);  // A = Q^T*D*Q
		float3 offdiag(D[1][2],D[0][2],D[0][1]); // elements not on the diagonal
		float3 om(fabsf(offdiag.x),fabsf(offdiag.y),fabsf(offdiag.z)); // mag of each offdiag elem
		int k = (om.x &gt; om.y &amp;&amp; om.x &gt; om.z)?0: (om.y &gt; om.z)? 1 : 2; // index of largest element of offdiag
		int k1 = (k+1)%3;
		int k2 = (k+2)%3;
		if(offdiag[k]==0.0f) break;  // diagonal already
		float thet = (D[k2][k2]-D[k1][k1])/(2.0f*offdiag[k]);
		float sgn = (thet &gt; 0.0f)?1.0f:-1.0f;
		thet    *= sgn; // make it positive
		float t = sgn /(thet +((thet &lt; 1.E6f)?sqrtf(sqr(thet)+1.0f):thet)) ; // sign(T)/(|T|+sqrt(T^2+1))
		float c = 1.0f/sqrtf(sqr(t)+1.0f); //  c= 1/(t^2+1) , t=s/c 
		if(c==1.0f) break;  // no room for improvement - reached machine precision.
		Quaternion jr(0,0,0,0); // jacobi rotation for this iteration.
		jr[k] = sgn*sqrtf((1.0f-c)/2.0f);  // using 1/2 angle identity sin(a/2) = sqrt((1-cos(a))/2)  
		jr[k] *= -1.0f; // since our quat-to-matrix convention was for v*M instead of M*v
		jr.w  = sqrtf(1.0f - sqr(jr[k]));
		if(jr.w==1.0f) break; // reached limits of floating point precision
		q =  q*jr;  
		q.Normalize();
	} 
	return q;
  }

			Diagonalizing a symmetric 3x3 has various useful applications such as 
			diagonalizing <a href="volint.html">inertia tensors</a>, fitting OBBs, finding 
			principal axes, etc. The diagonal entries of the diagonalized matrix are the 
			eigenvalues and the quaternion represents the eigenvectors in that the rows of 
			the corresponding matrix are the eigenvectors. Note that would be the matrix's 
			columns for you colum-major people out there.
                        Note: The actual code on my <a href="https://github.com/melax/sandbox">github site</a> may use some different conventions (naming style and now in column major).
		</p>
		<p>
			This code is kept simple so that it should be easy to grab and incorporate into 
			your own 3D math library or game application. Rename vector, matrix and quat 
			types as you see fit. Be aware of any matrix storage (row vs column) and 
			multiplying order conventions that you might be using. The code assumes 
			C-language row-major and D3D conventions for the matrix element ordering (for 
			example v_world=v_local*M). You might have noticed the comments write <code>D=Q*M*Q^T</code>, 
			whereas a column-centric linear algebra textbook would likely write <code>D=Q^T*M*Q</code>
			instead. The quaternion association with matrices and multiplication is the 
			same ordering that literally everybody uses. To the best of my knowledge, this 
			includes D3DX's quaternion implementation even though its opposite D3D's matrix 
			ordering which would mean: <code>(Qa*Qb).AsMatrix()==Qb.AsMatrix()*Qa.AsMatrix()</code>
		. Anyways, the function can easily be modified to conform to your preference if 
		its different.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you call the routine for a matrix M and get a quaternion q whose 
			corresponding matrix is Q and then compute D=Q*M*Q^T you will probably notice 
			that the off diagonal elements of D are not quite zero. The internals of the 
			algorithm are all 32bit float. Changing this to double might improve the 
			result. Even then, the resulting quaternion will be represented with finite 
			precision (32bit xyzw). For the functions main loop, I just hardcoded an 
			iteration limit of 24. No good reason for that number. Hurling dozens of random 
			symmetric matricies at the function, i didn't see it use more than 7 before 
			satisfying one of the exit conditions. Note the random entries were initialized 
			with (float)rand()/(float)rand(). Of what I saw, the offdiagonal elements were 
			always many orders of magnitude smaller than the largest diagonal element and 
			smaller than the smallest diagonal. Further coverage testing in more extreme 
			cases might be useful.

			To give credit where credit is due, some guy named Jacobi figured out this 
			diagonalization technique a long time ago. In an iterative fashion, the off 
			diagonal elements are simply "rotated away". The algebra to derive all this is 
			a bit trickier since you have the matrices on both sides (the diagonalizer and 
			its inverse). Numerical recipes 11.1, <i>Jacobi Transformations of a Symmetric 
				Matrix</i>, shows all the derivation including that clever t=s/c 
			substitution which leads to the formula showing how to compute the sin and cos 
			for the next incremental rotation. The Numerical Recipes version makes 
			additional speed optimizations and adds complexity that seems unnecessary for 
			the 3x3 case. I just ignored all that and just used Jacobi's raw idea but 
			incrementally build up a quaternion at each iteration instead of the matrix 
			sequence. (Using the half-angle identity makes it easy to construct the delta 
			quaternion directly.) Consequently the resulting code is fairly simple and 
			should jive with your typical game engine math library.
			Special thanks to John Schultz for his collaboration on gamedev.net and 
			for trying out the code and comparing results to alternative implementations.
