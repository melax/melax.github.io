    The downloadable zip file: <a href="BSPdemos2001.zip">BSPdemos2001.zip</a> contains two technical demos (melaxbsp.exe and melaxcsg.exe) that show interaction and geomod using bsp trees.  
    See the readme, help, and cfg files in the zip file for more information about the demos.  Try hitting the 'b' key when running the CSG demo to have some fun.

<p> The collision detection of swept volumes is done using bsp plane shifting and the csg boolean operations is done by tree merging.  
    The academic paper <a href="melaxbsp.pdf"><i>Dynamic Plane Shifting BSP Traversal</i></a>, from GI2000, explains the collision technique for moving objects.
    A 2001 <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131508/bsp_collision_detection_as_used_in_.php">gamastra article</a> elaborates on the collision detection in video game settings.
    Apparently, there's a <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/193231/Video_Collision_detection_in_MDK2_NeverWinter_Nights.php"> gdc presentation</a> (but the slides aren't visible).

        GI <i>Abstract:</i> Interactive 3D applications require fast detection
        of objects colliding with the environment. One popular
        method for fast collision detection is to offset the
        geometry of the environment according to the dimensions
        of the object, and then represent the object as a point
        (and the object's movement as a line segment).
        Previously, this geometry offset has been done in a
        preprocessing step and therefore requires knowledge
        of the object's dimensions before runtime. Furthermore,
        an extra copy of the environment's geometry is required
        for each shape used in the application. This paper
        presents a variation of the BSP tree collision algorithm
        that shifts the planes in order to offset the geometry of
        the environment at runtime. To prevent unwanted cases
        where offset geometry protrudes too much, extra plane
        equations, which bevel solid cells of space during
        expansion, are added by simply inserting extra nodes at
        the bottom of the tree. A simple line segment check can
        be used for collision detection of a moving object of
        any size against the environment. Only one BSP tree is
        needed by the application. Successful usage within
        commercial entertainment software is also discussed.
